# TICK-KING
Project dependencies:
 - Working mySQL workbench to create your instance of the database
 - Run Apache and mySQL server on XAMPP (Hit the start buttom for both)
 - I woud recommend VS code for the IDEA since it supports all languages and it is easy to work with a project that contains many different files and folders
 - Here is the link for Vs code: https://code.visualstudio.com/ (It is free)
 - You will also have to download Python if you havent already: https://www.python.org/downloads/
 - This video help downloading python and configuring pip command to download the packages below: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdUZArA-kZw
  
 - This project also depends on a few libraries/packages. The three that must be downloaded are the following:
   - Flask (Web app framework to make our lifes a little easier): https://pypi.org/project/Flask/
   - Flask-MySQLdb (Provides a connection pathway to mySQL database): https://pypi.org/project/Flask-MySQLdb/
   - passlib (for password hashing and hash comparisson): https://pypi.org/project/passlib/
   
   I have been using python already so my computer is all configured with python and the pip- command. If you need help running this project just let me know
   
Once everything is installed:
 - Run the app.py file
 - head to your local host address
